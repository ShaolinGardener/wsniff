# wsniff [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Discover%20and%20sniff%20WiFi%20networks%20with%20wsniff!&url=https://github.com/JulianWindeck/wsniff&hashtags=dot11,security,wsniff,sniffing)
A WiFi sniffer you can use with your Raspberry Pi and simply control over your smartphone - discover 802.11 networks, capture their traffic or create interactive wardriving maps. The all-in-one solution with a comfortable
 graphical user interface. üå±

## üìù Requirements
You will need:
- a Raspberry Pi (at least the 3B version)
- a GPS module connected to the Pi in case you want to use the wardriving functions
- a USB WiFi adapter that supports monitor mode (otherwise sniffing would not make sense anyway)

## Setup 
Before you begin with this setup process, make sure you have an active Internet connection.
It's also recommendable to execute `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade` before you start.

0. It might be the case your Wi-Fi is blocked by rfkill because you haven't set your Wi-Fi country yet.
In order to fix this, use raspi-config to set the country before use:
```sh
sudo raspi-config
```
In this dialog, first choose 'Localization Options' and then 'WLAN Country'. Here you should select your country and then confirm your choice by pressing \<Enter\>. After that, you can exit the settings menu by pressing \<Escape\>.

1. Clone the project from Github
```sh
cd <path_to_install_to>
git clone https://github.com/JulianWindeck/wsniff 
```
2. Install the software 
```
cd wsniff
./setup.sh
```

3. Now, you have to reboot:
```sh
sudo reboot 
```

4. In theory, you are now ready to go and [can start the software](#start-wsniff).
However, if you want to be able to control your sniffer with your smartphone
or another mobile device, you should set up the internal WiFi card of the Pi as an Access Point. 
In order to do that, be sure you are in the wsniff directory and execute the following script (which automates the steps from [this official manual](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-a-routed-wireless-access-point)):
```sh
sudo python3 setupAccessPoint.py
```
After a reboot (`sudo systemctl reboot`), you should be able to connect to the new wireless network of the Raspberry. 
- SSID: wsniff
- default password: feedmepackets

Recommendation: Connect with your smartphone since it can be quite fun to control your sniffer with it.

## Start wsniff
Be sure you are in the wsniff directory which you cloned from Github.

Then, you can start wsniff with (it can be you have to prepend 'sudo'):
```sh
python3 startup.py
```
After you have executed that command, you can use the browser of the device you have connected to the Pi in the previous step and type in the Pi's IP-address.
Now the web interface of wsniff should appear where you should create a new account first.
If you have used the setupAccessPoint.py script from above to set up the Raspberry as a wireless access point, you can also browse to 'wsniff.com' after connecting to the 'wsniff' WiFi network.

## üñã Adapt wsniff
- After the installation of new packages you should update requirements.txt:
```sh
pip freeze > ./res/requirements.txt
```

- For changes on the design activate the automatic transpilation of Sass: 
```sh
sass --watch ./sass:./css //zum Abbrechen im Terminal Ctrl-C
```
